# Biomcmc 

This library has the low level functions used by other programs. 
It borrows many functions from the [guenomu software](https://bitbucket.org/leomrtns/guenomu/) for phylogenomic species tree inference and 
also from the [genefam-dist library](https://github.com/leomrtns/genefam-dist).

## Installation
This library usually is not installed directly, but as a submodule of another project. It includes the 'makefile.am' for
autotools.
