	* topology_is_equal_unrooted() must be simplified and not on splitset_distances;
	* backbone_tree_is_equal() may be created to check if induced trees/subtrees are same (not in topology_common but in
	genetree, even if comparing two sptrees
	* bipartition.c may have tripartion, and also hash functions (unfinished algorithms)
	* create clade struct for sptree induced partitions
	* removed t1<->t2 comparisons since can't handle missing data. However we still assume that all gene leaves are found
	in species trees, but it's better to allow for missing 'species' (e.g. when comparing two orthologous trees with
	missing data on both): easier for bipartitions (we can mask them) but harder for reconciliation.
